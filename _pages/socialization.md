### Instructions:
Sharing life experiences with someone from a different age group can teach you valuable life lessons and help you gain exposure to new perspectives. Here are some suggestions for conversation starters with a young child or elder person:
    - Describe the environment you grew up in
    - What surprises you most about the world today
    - What is the most important thing to you right now?
    - What does mental wellbeing mean to you?

### Evidence:
Studies like this one from Stanford show that intergenerational relationships are mutually beneficial and important for society, allowing children from vulnerable populations to gain valuable guidance and older adults to experience the excitement of learning about new technology and trends [Parker (2016). *Older People Offer Resources that Children Need, Stanford Report Says*]
