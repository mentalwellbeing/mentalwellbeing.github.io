### Academic:
Please take a moment to think about your best possible academic/work/socia life during your present and future. Imagine that everything will go as well as it possibly could. Perhaps you have successfully chosen a concentration or thesis project that you enjoy and are achieving good grades in all of your classes. Furthermore, perhaps your academic studies challenge you enough to keep you engaged without feeling too overwhelming. Think of this as the realization of the best possible academic life you could ever hope for yourself.
