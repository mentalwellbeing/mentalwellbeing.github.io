# Best Possible Self:

&nbsp;

*Time: 10m+*

&nbsp;

***These are four activities, one linked to academic life, one to work/professional life, one to social life, and a fourth  to health, and the instructions will change slightly for each.***

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Choose just one area to focus on today: 

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

### Academic:
Please take a moment to think about your best possible academic/work/socia life during your present and future. Imagine that everything will go as well as it possibly could. Perhaps you have successfully chosen a concentration or thesis project that you enjoy and are achieving good grades in all of your classes. Furthermore, perhaps your academic studies challenge you enough to keep you engaged without feeling too overwhelming. Think of this as the realization of the best possible academic life you could ever hope for yourself. 

### Professional:
Please take a moment to think about your best possible career. Imagine that everything has gone as well as it possibly could. Perhaps you have been able to obtain a new job or internship that will help you work towards your future career goals. Furthermore, you enjoy your day to day and find your work meaningful. Think of this as the realization of the best possible career preparation you could ever hope for yourself.

### Social:
Please take a moment to think about your best possible social life. Imagine that everything has gone as well as it possibly could. Perhaps you have developed good relationships with your friends at your work or university. Furthermore, you may have gotten involved with extracurricular activities. Think of this as the realization of the best possible social life you could ever hope for yourself.

### Health:
Please take a moment to think about your best possible health. Imagine that everything has gone as well as it possibly could. Perhaps you have started working out regularly, eating healthy and are feeling great. Furthermore, you may have set exciting goals regarding your health. Think of this as the realization of the best possible health you could ever hope for yourself.

***Now, for the next 10 minutes, please write continuously about what you imagined. Use the instructions below to help guide you through this process:

1. Be as creative and imaginative as you desire.
2. Use whatever writing style you please, but remember to imagine your ideal life in the FUTURE over the next 3 or 5 years. 
3. Do not worry about perfect grammar and spelling. 
4. Use as much detail as you want.***
